# UWP Icon Extractor

This is a .NET Framework library that exports a method which takes a UWP process window handle as an input and returns the path to the "small icon" used by the associated process.

Particularly created for my [alttab-replacer](https://github.com/monoblaine/alttab-replacer) project.
